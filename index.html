    <h2>What's in this book</h2>
    <p class="intro">Using the principles developed by the educator Dr. Maria Montessori, Simone Davies shows us how to support children‚Äôs natural curiosity and learning. She provides a lot of practical ideas for living with a toddler and feeding
      children‚Äôs natural curiosity, especially the step-by-step ways to make daily routines with ease, like eating on their own, brushing teeth, toilet-training‚Ä¶

    <p>Plus ideas about how we can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Stay composed and set limits with love and respect - without resorting to bribes or punishment.</li>
      <li>Set up the environment and get rid of the chaos</li>
      <li>Create Montessori activities that are just right for our one-to-three-year-old.</li>
      <li>Be children's guide, encourage them exploring the world around them.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>I like the idea from the book :</h2>
    <div class="my-description">
      <p>We encourage children take full advantage of self-motivation instead of using bribes or punishment. Children can proceed at their own pace in a non-competitive environment to explore and develop their love of
        learning.</p>
      <p>From this book, I have learnt that it‚Äôs time to change the way we see toddlers, and we would be surprised when we ‚ÄôTrust in the child‚Äô. I also believe that Children could follow their natural tendencies towards independence.
